Mobile Robotics Homework 3B
Max Bogue and Mike Tesch

We conducted the goto tests using both of our implementations.  For each of
us, the robot would come back to within roughly 6 inches of its original
position each time around the square.  However, the square it traversed
seemed to be slightly skewed; that is, it would turn slightly initially,
then move in a square from there.  This may have been due to the robot
incorrectly initializing its position, or something akin to that.

For the obstacle avoidance tests we used Mike's code, as Max’s was not fully
functional with sonar.  The test was reliably successful when the robot had
to go around the corner to the left, but not to the right (apparently
negative angles aren’t handled correctly).  The behavior was tentative,
alternating between moving forward slightly and adjusting the angle as it
went around the corner.  This behavior could likely be improved by allowing
the robot to move slightly faster as it turns.
