After 5+ hours of fiddling with things and trying to figure out why my robot
still loves to run into walls, I've had no luck.  I got it to the first
waypoint once, but then discovered that it would only dodge things on the
left.  I can only assume I'm screwing something up with the conversion from
sensor data into local-coordinates, but I haven't the slightest idea what.

I think my local minima algorithm is correct, but I would always get 4+ hits,
which was always more than expected.  I didn't know what sort of function to
use for the constants in the equation, because everything I tried (quadratic,
linear, with difference scalars) failed pretty miserably.  Not the most fun
or productive learning experience.
