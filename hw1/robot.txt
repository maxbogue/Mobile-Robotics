Sensors:

Pressure - water depth to within a few millimeters.
Radio - communicates the use of the charging station with other AquaJellies.
Light - to observe the position of other AquaJellies to evade.
Internal - energy levels to decide when to go back to a charging station,
           and the orientation of the propulsion system.

Actuators:

8 blue and 8 white LEDs (or 11 infrared? Conflicting info in the doc...) for
communication with other AquaJellies and 8 tentacles for propulsion.  Also
radio for other communications.

Tasks:

Survive.  The AquaJellies are designed to exist in a large basin with other
AquaJellies, evading them until their battery runs low, when they seek out a
charging station.

The AquaJelly is fairly useless as-is for any other purpose, but the design
could be adapted to various underwater surveillance tasks.
