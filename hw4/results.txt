Mobile Robot Programming, Homework 4
Max Bogue

My system worked decently.  In simulation, I was able to create a
pretty accurate map (simulation.png).  Using the same code, I got an
almost-recognizable map of the hallway circuit around the lab in GCCIS
(gccis.png).  However, the simulation map was created over several
minutes of wandering the same area.

Upon inspection of a simulation run in real-time, I've noticed that the
code handles close walls extremely poorly.  My theory is that the
exponential function I'm using falls off too quickly for many pixels to be
drawn, thus the walls appear to be ignored.  Sadly I'm out of time to play
with it before the deadline for this assignment, but I plan to try
modifying that function somehow to account for d.

Overall, I was pleased with the result.  I think my reality map would have
been improved with a tweak in my current code: for some reason I was using
15 as the object odds when near the detected object; I've dropped this to
3 and I believe that would have removed much of the excess noise.
